## üí° Pro Tips

### For Development (ngrok)
- Free tier gives you random URLs
- Perfect for testing Agentverse integration
- Restart ngrok to get new URL if needed

### For Production (Railway/Render)
- Get permanent URLs
- Better for hackathon submissions
- Automatic HTTPS and scaling

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test your public endpoint
curl https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/health
```

**Recommendation:** Start with ngrok for immediate testing, then move to Railway/Render for permanent deployment.
